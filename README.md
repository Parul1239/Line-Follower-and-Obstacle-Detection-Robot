# Line-Follower-and-Obstacle-Detection-Robot
Follow a line drawn on the floor and Detects object along the path

The line follower and obstacle detection robot is an electronic system/robot that can detect and
follow a line drawn on the floor. The path is pre-defined and can be either visible like a black line
on a white surface. Infrared sensors are used to detect the line which the robot has to follow. The IR
sensor is meant to trace a particular line and ultrasonic sensors are meant to detect obstacles which
it encounters. The robot movement is automatic and can be used for long distance application. By
using ultrasonic sensor, the line follower robot can detect an obstacle and stop till the obstacle is
removed. The base of the robot is Arduino UNO R3 which is a microcontroller board based on the
ATmega328.
